I'm **Elena**, an experienced **frontend developer** with a strong passion for building effective websites. My goal is to ensure that every pixel is precisely aligned and every element of UI functions seamlessly, providing users with an intuitive and efficient digital experience.

I get great inspiration from modern web design and I feel excitement when starting to work with a new design markup. I always have fun doing some especially challenging layout, implementing unusual effects or animation. 🌟
